Pinky swear, if I do tell a lie
I'm willing to swallow needles or anything Monday
It doesn’t matter if it's Sunday
Mirror, Mirror on the wall
Who would give me the most fairest love of them all?
No need to ask cause it's my darling

I want you to be my last
If I had to keep being separated from you like this
I’d rather die
I'd rather die
I choose you over three meals a day
If I had to keep being separated from you like this
I'd rather die
I'd rather die
