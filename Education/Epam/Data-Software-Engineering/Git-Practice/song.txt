She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (oh-oh), hey-ey

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (hoo)
She says I am the one (oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

For forty days and for forty nights, law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice) do think twice (ah-hoo)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
Go and dance on the floor in the round, baby (ooh, hee-hee-hee)
